                    <p class="p1">Raindrops on my shed,<br>
                        Reminds me of you, dear.<br>
                        See, I am not alone now,<br>
                        The sky has also tears. <br> <br>
                        
                        These winds seem like, <br>
                        They have something to say. <br>
                        I guess you left a message in the air, <br>
                        Which they are trying to convey. <br> <br>
                        
                        On a faraway tree, <br>
                        I can see some birds in the nest. <br>
                        The little ones are trying to be free, <br>
                        But their mom is saying "be patient." <br> <br>
                        
                        Patience, Hope, or Acceptance, <br>
                        Quite simple words to say. <br> <br>
                        
                        Well, I am still trying my best, <br> <br>
                        
                        Regardless of the heavy rain, <br>
                        There prevails a Sun-Ray.

                    <p class="p1">While walking down the road, <br>
                        I spotted your old house. <br>
                        Dusty, gloomy now birds abode, <br>
                        A tourist place for mouse. <br> <br>
                        
                        A strange reflection from window, <br>
                        Disturbed my nostalgic sight. <br>
                        I sneaked in our old place, <br>
                        In search of that light. <br> <br>
                        
                        Darkness surrounds me, <br> <br>
                        
                        No more your running sounds. <br>
                        No more your happiness or glee. <br>
                        No more your joyous rounds. <br> <br>
                        
                        I followed the reflection tho, <br>
                        It was emerging from your room. <br>
                        That was from below your pillow, <br> <br>
                        
                        A picture of us, <br>
                        That we promised to keep; I assume.

                    <p class="p1">I saw many things, <br>
                        In the past few days of my life. <br>
                        Someone got everything, <br>
                        And some lost their Mom, Dad, or Wife. <br> <br>
                        
                        People traveling 1000s of Km, <br>
                        Starving, bare-footed, and dying. <br>
                        Carrying their children on back, <br>
                        Walking in long mirageous line. <br> <br>
                        
                        Some lost their family and dime, <br>
                        Some got their family time. <br>
                        Some were laughing at home, <br>
                        Some were crying for home. <br> <br>
                        
                        I wanted to help all of them, <br>
                        I wish I had that power. <br>
                        Why GOD empowers evil-doers? <br>
                        Why GOD lives so far? <br> <br>
                        
                        This Lockdown, <br>
                        It taught me so many lessons. <br>
                        When you drown, <br>
                        No one helps you from mansions. <br> <br>
                        
                        O God; You see everything, <br>
                        At least help those who believe you. <br>
                        I ask you no money, nothing, <br>
                        Just some meal, to feed a few. <br> <br>
                        
                        Give them my happiness, <br>
                        I don't want it anymore. <br>
                        Pls, Accept my few requests, <br> <br>
                        
                        I wish I could help some more. <br>

                    <p class="p1">
                        This is the first time I'm writing a story. I am gonna try my best tho lol. <br> <br>

                        So, It is a real incident when our school was returning from 2 days of the Amritsar tour. On the way back we headed to Ludhiana, where I have lived for a year around 5 years back. And I remember there was a huge market there called 'Chawri Bazaar'. So, I asked our Sir, that there is a huge market here, And I knew that place very well, I could make everyone visit there. And you know about girls and female teachers, They were like "Yes Sir, that would be a great idea". So, our innocent Sir agreed and we headed to the market. It was 2:00 pm as far as I remember. <br> <br>

                        I was in front leading the whole team, was feeling like a Captain there. After going somewhat inside the market, which seemed a new place to me, I couldn't recognize any of the shops there. So, I picked out my phone and asked for help from Google baba (map). But couldn't recognize any of the places on the map as well. It was like the whole place was transformed in 5 years. <br> <br>

                        I had class 9th, 10th students and teachers with me. I couldn't let myself down in front of them as well. So, I said follow me and we were moving forward, And By luck, we started getting some shops, I was relieved. Female teachers attacked the suit sari and cosmetic shops as usual. And they went back from there. We didn't realize that at that time. Now I have 10th and 9th students with me. We were moving and shouting with joy, (honestly don't know with what joy). My friends were enjoying it as hell. A shopkeeper was shouting 200 for a pair of shoes, and one of my friends asked him, "Can I get 1 shoe for 100". And in return, he just got some mere abuses. I knew a shop there, where 2 or 3 skinny guys used to stand on a table in underwears and used to shout like 100 ke 4 kacche le jao (take 4 underwears in 100 rs), that shop used to be my frame of reference for that market because it was in the centre of it, but unfortunately, I couldn't find it. <br> <br>

                        We kept moving and saw a gol-gppe wala and we gathered around him 12-14 children ig. He got confused and started giving us gol-gppe. I ate 3 and stepped back from that crowd and some of my friends did the same as well. Now they left with 3 class 9th children there and that gol-gppe wala told him the bill was 140 rs. and they were searching for us lol, but couldn't find us. That gol-gppe wala ran behind them and I don't know where they went. <br> <br>

                        Now we left with 10 of us ig. and we were just wandering here and there, One of my friend asking 2nd hand I-phone's price even when he only had a 10 rupee torn note in his pocket, he was just fucking around, One of them said "I-phone sucks don't buy it, bro, you will just waste your money". One of them bought a ladies' watch, I asked him "why bro?" he replied, "For my future girlfriend... ". One of my friends took me to a shop to choose a shirt for him, He chose a purple shirt with flowers on it. Honestly, It was the worst shirt I had ever seen. But he liked it. He was like "Bro, this is an awesome shirt, What do you say?" He was so determined to hear a Yes, So, I couldn't deny him. Then he asked the shopkeeper for its price, that man said 500 rs. I was like "Who on earth could ever give you 500 rs for this shit!". But I didn't say that, So, we started bargaining which is in our Indian culture. And we reached 300 rs. He was just about to pay for it, and from nowhere my another friend came and he was like "Bc, ye kya tatti khareed rha hai"...(Bro, why are you buying this shit!). So, our 1-hour bargaining went in vain and we moved out from that shop. <br> <br>

                        It was 5:00 pm now, Our Sir started calling us "Come back, It's time". But honestly, we didn't care. We just ran here and there for 30 mins more, 'don't know why!', After that Sir started calling, again and again, And I was like we are on our way. But honestly, we didn't know where we were! and after 30 more mins. Those Class 9th students lost faith in me, and they said "We will find the bus ourselves." and left the gp. After they left I said, "Ab hume inse pehle phuchna hai bas" (now we have to reach before them only), we started running asking people abt. that place and finally at 6:30 pm we reached back to our bus. And we were so glad to see that no one from class 9th was there, Sir asked "where is class 9th". I said, "I don't know, I told them sir is calling and they were like, we don't care, we aren't coming". <br> <br>

                        So, Sir went to find them and came alone after half an hour, He was furious and then around 7:30 pm those 9th lads showed up, and they got beaten very badly by our furious Sir, LOL. <br> <br>

                        And after all this, we reached back home at 3:00 am because of me... <br> <br>

                        Believe me, School life is the best time till class 10th. 'Enjoy it, or you gonna regret it in later.' <br> <br>

                        You are gonna study your whole life. But these moments are so precious. Believe me...
